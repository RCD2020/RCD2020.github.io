                Frank Rosenblatt had thought that neurons could be
                simulated using perceptrons -->

                The Perceptron was conceptualized in 1957 by Frank
                Rosenblatt. By then, scientists had figured that neurons
                in the brain uses electrical signals to input and output
                information as well as store information in the neuron.
                Based off that, on an IBM 704 computer at the Cornell
                Aeronautical Laboratory, wrote the first Perceptron
                program, a datastructure that simulates the neuron using
                inputs and weights.
