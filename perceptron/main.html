                Frank Rosenblatt had thought that neurons could be
                simulated using perceptrons -->

                The Perceptron was conceptualized in 1957 by Frank
                Rosenblatt. By then, scientists had figured that neurons
                in the brain uses electrical signals to input and output
                information as well as store information in the neuron.
                Based off that, on an IBM 704 computer at the Cornell
                Aeronautical Laboratory, wrote the first Perceptron
                program, a datastructure that simulates the neuron using
                inputs and weights.

                <br>

                The first part of the perceptron is the input. The input
                can be represented as a series of <b>nodes</b>,
                originally binary inputs ($x_i$) all with their own
                individual <b>weight</b> ($w_i$). We will then get the
                sum of all the inputs and weights multiplied,
                represented by the following equation:

                $$
                \sum^n_{i=0}{x_i \cdot w_i}
                $$

                Now we must determine our <b>threshold</b> value. The
                threshold will be compared to the results of the
                previous equation to determine whether the final output
                will be 1 or 0. This value will be adjusted throughout
                the training process to determine the best results, but
                if you are looking for something in the middle, you take
                the sum of the weights and divide by 2.

                $$
                \frac{\sum^n_{i=0}{w_i}}{2}
                $$

                Now using our threshold, we can determine the
                <b>Activation Function</b>. The activation function
                determines whether the the final output of the
                perceptron, originally a 1 or a 0. It is simply
                represented as $sum > threshold$.
