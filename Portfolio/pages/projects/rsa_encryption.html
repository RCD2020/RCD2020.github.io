                    This RSA Encryption application is an asynchronous
                    web implementation of asymmetrical encryption, the
                    concept of encrypting messages one way, using a
                    depryption key kept secret to the encrypting client.

                    Fascinated by the world of CyberSecurity, I've been
                    looking into how data is encrypted, and much to my
                    surprise, even after the encryption, it is still
                    very insecure! If two computers have to tell each
                    other how to encrypt messages, then what is to stop
                    a third party from listening to the network to get
                    ahold of the encryption method so that they can
                    decrypt it? This question led me to asymmetrical
                    encryption.

                    The first step to any good encryption algorithm is
                    to choose our prime numbers. The reason we use prime
                    numbers is because when we do operations with these
                    numbers, it is incredibly difficult and time
                    intensive to find large prime factors of our
                    products. To generate a prime number, I basically
                    just repeatedly generated random numbers, and then
                    using the Miller-Rabin primality test, checked if
                    those random numbers were prime or not. The
                    Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic test
                    that fairly accurately tells when a number is prime.
                    It does this be generating a number of tests that
                    would give us evidence that it is prime or not.
                    There are going to be some non prime numbers that
                    slip through, however they should be far and few in
                    between.
