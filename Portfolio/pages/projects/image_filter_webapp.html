                <p>
                    The Image Filter Webapp was my final project for
                    <a href="/education#cs50x">Harvard's CS50x</a>. Inspired by a
                    previous assignment where I wrote image filters using C, I decided
                    to make a web application where any user can upload an image and
                    write code to filter it, without having to go through the process of
                    figuring out how to open, write, and save an image. All users have
                    to do is upload an image of their choice, and then they will be
                    taken to a page where they can write code the interacts with the
                    image's pixel values.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Details</h3>
                <p>
                    On the main page of the site, you can upload your own image. In the
                    background, the app will check that it is a valid png file, and if
                    so, it will save it to the server and redirect you to a page where
                    you can start writing filter code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few examples of filters, e.g. grayscale, sepia tone, and
                    sobel's edge detection, but ultimately the user is free to input
                    write whatever they want. The language is my own custom make and is
                    somewhat of a crossover of C and Python. It's not terribly well put
                    together nor is it efficient, however I went with the choice to
                    write a programming language for the experience more than anything
                    else, and learned lots from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the user is satisfied with their code, they can go ahead and
                    filter the image, where their code will be sent through my
                    interpreter, and applied to the image, where from there the user
                    will be redirected to a page containing their filtered image.
