# Portfolio

This is my portfolio page, by visiting [this page](https://RCD2020.github.io), you can access a list of all my programming repositories as well as data science articles I've written.

# Implementation

My portfolio is hosted through GitHub pages, which poses a few problems. For example, GitHub pages serves static pages, meaning I am unable to use any backend code. And while true that's not too big of a deal for a portfolio, I'm still a programmer at heart, and so I've written Javascript function that will write the webpage for me so I don't need to hardcode every project. This is done by reading a dictionary that defines the title, links to the media, a description, and lists out what technologies I used for each project, and then there is a javascript function that will loop through this dictionary and build the webpage with working links and icons.
