            <h2>
                What is Linear Algrebra?
            </h2>

            <p>
                To understand what Linear Algebra is, first we should
                understand what a linear equation is. A linear equation
                is an equation where each value includes no
                exponentiation (other than $1$) and isn't passed into
                any functions. For example:

                $$
                x + y + z = 0
                $$
                $$
                a + b + c + d + e = 54
                $$

                Examples of equations that are not linear include:

                $$
                x^2 + y = 3
                $$
                <div class="context">
                    This is not a linear equation because it includes
                    exponentiation.
                </div>

                $$
                sin(x) + log(y) = 13
                $$
                <div class="context">
                    This is not a linear equation because it passes
                    variables into functions.
                </div><br><br>

                And what linear algebra is is a way for us to solve
                variables for sets of linear equations. By leveraging
                it, we can more quickly and efficiently solve problems
                pertaining to computer graphics, electrical engineering,
                or what we will be using it for, data science and
                artificial intelligence.
                <br>
                This is done by following a pretty simple equation:
                $$
                M * w = v
                $$
                Where $M$ is a matrix, $w$ is a vector holding our
                variables in a set of linear equations, and $v$ is a
                vector holding the answers to our set of linear
                equations.

                A vector is an object that both has a magnitude as well
                as a direction. It can be denoted in boldface or with a
                arrow over the name such as $\textbf{a}$
                or $\overrightarrow{a} \ $. The magnitude of a vector is
                how much it moved, and can be denoted like so: $||\textbf{a}||$.
