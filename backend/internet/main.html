            <h2>Conception</h2>

            <p>
                The internet was developed in the late 1960's by the
                United States Department of Defense as a means of
                creating a decentralized communication network that
                could withstand a nuclear attack. Over the years, it has
                evolved into a complex and sophisticated network that
                spans the globe.

        <div id="works">
            <h2>How it Works</h2>

            <p>
                The internet works by connecting devices and computer
                systems together using a set of standardized protocols.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="protocols">
            <h2>Protocols</h2>

            <p>
                When data is transmitted over the internet, it is often
                broken down into smaller chunks called <em>packets</em>,
                and then transferred according to a set of rules and
                standards that define how information is exchanged
                between devices and systems in order to ensure that
                it is being exchanged reliably and safely.

                By having a univsersal set of standardized protocols,
                devices from different manufacturers and vendors can
                communicate seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h3>Internet Protocol (IP)</h3>
            <p>
                IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct
                destination by using IP addresses. An IP address is a
                unique identifier assigned to each device on a network,
                typically represented as a series of four numbers
                separated by periods, such as <strong>192.168.1.1</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h3>
            <p>
                TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in
                the correct order.
            </p>

            <h3>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h3>
            <p>
                UDP ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and
                efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
            <p>
                A domain name is a human readable name used to identify
                a website or other internet resources, 
                typically composed of two or more parts, separated by periods,
                such as <em>google.com</em>.<br>
                
                A DNS will take
                those domain names and translate them into IP Addresses
                so that the computer knows where to send information.
            </p>

            <h3>HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP and HTTPS are two of the most commonly used
                protocols in internet-based applications and services.
                <br>
                HTTP is used to transfer data between a client (such as
                a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
                <br>
                Whenever you visit a website, your web browser sends
                a HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or
                other resources you've requested. The server then sends
                an HTTP response back to the client, containing the
                requested data.
                <br>
                HTTPS is the same as HTTP except for one extremely
                important difference, it encrypts the data so that
                bad actors who have gotten access to the network cannot
                read your messages. This is done by running the data
                through something called an SSL/TLS layer.
                <br>
                You can tell if a webpage is using HTTPS by obviously
                if the url starts with https:// or most browsers will
                display a padlock icon in the address bar.

            <h2>How do apps connect?</h2>
            <p>
                Generally, we know that computers are able to find each
                other using IP addresses, but let's break that down.
