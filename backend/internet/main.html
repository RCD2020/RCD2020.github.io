            <h2>Conception</h2>

            <p>
                The internet was developed in the late 1960's by the
                United States Department of Defense as a means of
                creating a decentralized communication network that
                could withstand a nuclear attack. Over the years, it has
                evolved into a complex and sophisticated network that
                spans the globe.

        </div>

        <div id="works">
            <h2>How it Works</h2>

            <p>
                The internet works by connecting devices and computer
                systems together using a set of standardized protocols.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="protocols">
            <h2>Protocols</h2>

            <p>
                When data is transmitted over the internet, it is often
                broken down into smaller chunks called <em>packets</em>,
                and then transferred according to a set of rules and
                standards that define how information is exchanged
                between devices and systems in order to ensure that
                it is being exchanged reliably and safely.

                By having a univsersal set of standardized protocols,
                devices from different manufacturers and vendors can
                communicate seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h3>Internet Protocol (IP)</h3>
            <p>
                IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct
                destination by using IP addresses. An IP address is a
                unique identifier assigned to each device on a network,
                typically represented as a series of four numbers
                separated by periods, such as <strong>192.168.1.1</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h3>
            <p>
                TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in
                the correct order.
            </p>

            <h3>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h3>
            <p>
                UDP ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and
                efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Domain Name System (DNS)</h3>
            <p>
                A domain name is a human readable name used to identify
                a website or other internet resources, 
                typically composed of two or more parts, separated by periods,
                such as <em>google.com</em>.<br>
                
                A DNS will take
                those domain names and translate them into IP Addresses
                so that the computer knows where to send information.
            </p>

            <h3>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
            <p>
                HTTP is used to transfer data between a client (such as
                a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
